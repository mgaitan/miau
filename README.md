# miau
Remix speeches for fun and profit

**work in progress**

`miau` is a command line tool to easily generate remixes of clips like political speeches. 

## how it works?

It uses [aeneas](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas) to syncronize the transcription (as a raw text) and the input audio/video file. Another text define the "output speech" using fragment of the input transcription, `miau` cuts them and joins each part using [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy). 


## why *miau*?

`miau` means `meow` in spanish. It's a joke about the popular (derogatory) [nickname assigned to Argentina's president](https://www.taringa.net/posts/noticias/19819104/Why-Macri-Cat.html) Mauricio "Cat" Macri. As I started this tool to make fun of Macri's speeches, this was a pretty obvious choice.
